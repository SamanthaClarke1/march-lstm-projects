The promulgation of this fact draws to his office a most startling variety of monstrosities, all anxious to submit to his esoteric powers, whereby they hope to become Utopian as to face and figure. In his suite are a number of cabinets, in which the mere confining of the patient works wonders, transforming unsightly Calibans into beautiful Houris. The first to enter his chambre mysterieux is a tiny mite of femininity. The young lady is less than three feet tall, but under the professor's wonderful treatment she grows rapidly, and while she has now attained a condition of extreme pulchritude, she is placed in a most embarrassing position from the fact that as she grows tall and stately her gowns have remained le meme, reaching only to the knees. Oh, mercy! As an absolute antithesis of his first patient there appears a young girl who, though fair of face, must have been a lineal descendant from Teutobochus, the ancient giant king. She is at least eight feet tall and surely a \"line of sweetness long drawn out.\" Placing her under a pile-driver, the hammer of which balances 3,000 pounds, the professor hypnotizes her and starts the machine. Blow upon blow is rained on her shapely head until at last she emerges, a Naiad of symmetrical loveliness. Then comes a lady sporting a pair of pedal extremities that would surely cause Chicago to look to her laurels. These are quickly reduced from their amplitudinous dimensions to the possibility of a \"Louis Quinze.\" The proboscis next requires the professor's attention, a handsomely dressed society lady appearing with a marcel wave on her nose. But watch the professor! While he is engaged with this patient the Gargantuan form of a woman comes waddling in. She looks like a balloon and moves along with the grace of the car of Juggernaut. She echoes Hamlet's plea, \"O, that this too, too solid flesh would melt, thaw and resolve itself into a dew!\" But Doc Skinum's the boy who knows what to do, and placing her on a stretcher, with a block and fall he lifts her onto the reducing table. He then turns on the current and through the pellucid vapor that arises we see the rapidly evanescent form of Elephantine Lizzie. The doctor having been called away by the lady with the distorted olfactory organ, whose footman had gotten into one of the cabinets and instantly changed to a policeman, forgets to turn off the fluid, and around goes the pointer on the indicator like the hand of a clepsydra, until, on his return, he finds poor Lizzie reduced to an infinitesimal modicum of her former self. In fact, she is about the size of a new-born infant. Here would be trouble for anyone but Skinum. So hurriedly placing her in the cabinet of beauty, she is transformed into a most charming duenna. These and many others are the amazing changes and cures performed by the old professor in the course of the film, which, as a whole, will prove a most effective cure for \"blues\" in the spectator whose good fortune it will be to view it, for it is unquestionably an assured laughing hit."},"The Prodigal Son":{"title":"The Prodigal Son","plot":"A rich man's son (Yuen Biao) believes himself to be the best kung fu fighter in Canton.

Hence it was that he hailed with keen delight the opportunity of taking a day off. No other arrangement was made than to spend the day as one of absolute rest at home. How well he succeeded is most lucidly shown in this Biograph film. It is during May, and we know what transpires in all well-regulated households during this month, and with cruel coincidence, his holiday and general house-cleaning were set for the same day. Jones starts in all right. He takes a fine cigar, the morning paper, selects the easiest chair in the parlor, and assumes for the nonce the air of a gentleman of leisure. But, alas, his beatific dream was rudely disturbed by Wifey: \"John, dear, I really cannot get this stovepipe back in place; it doesn't seem to fit.\" Well, we know what a prolix undertaking this is. John struggled and swore, fretted and fussed, until down came the whole affair, covering him with a suit of soot from head to feet. A bath is next in order. Having divested himself of this ebony complexion, he is back in the parlor, but hardly seated, when Mrs. Jones calls him to the kitchen to fix the water pipe. He succeeds only in getting a thorough drenching, and once more a change of apparel is necessary. This being done, his wife now demands he hang a picture. \"Ah, let us alone.\" But Wifey insists. A stepladder is brought in and Jones ascends it, armed with hammer and nails, with a large picture frame under his arm. The nail is held in position, and, \"Why, John!\" says Wifey, \"such language, and before baby.\" John had aimed the hammer at the nail head, but hit his thumb. Another blow, more vigorous than the first, is sent, \"Gee, whiz, twice in the same place. Biddy Mulligan.\" Jones, with a yell of pain, leaps in the air and there is a mad race between his head and the picture frame for the floor; it was a dead heat. Wifey is awfully sorry, and allows him to pacify and amuse himself with minding the baby, a delicate attention on her part. Still, it might be worse, and soon it is, for Wifey's voice is heard calling, \"John, dear, the gas is leaking.\" Jones, with a lighted candle, goes into the cellar in search of the leak, and finds it; and when the smoke and dust of the explosion clears away, poor John is seen stretched out on the cellar floor. Oh, but what's the use? John was given a day of rest by the boss, and he rests with a vengeance."},"Hulda's Lovers":{"title":"Hulda's Lovers","plot":"Hulda is a maiden fair to look upon.

And indeed, the black warriors are about to prepare a Dutch dinner, when the Queen does the Pocahontas act and, throwing herself on the prostrate form of Heinie, declares that they shall strike him only through her. So they desist, for such a thing would be impossible, as the Queen is so thick through, that the longest spear would hardly reach the victim. In fact, she is that obese she looks like a crowd.

She promises, and after vowing eternal fidelity the lovers part, agreeing to meet the following day at the same place and from there leave for other parts.

He proceeds directly to the home of the magistrate and tells of Rudolph's love for the Jewess. Lorenz is furious, will not believe the tale, and bids Nathan begone. At this time Rudolph appears, and being asked for the truth, haughtily admits his love for Leah. The old magistrate is heartbroken, and he and Nathan decide to buy off Leah with gold. Although indignant, Rudolph consents to have her love tested. Nathan leaves with the large purse of gold and shortly comes upon her. He offers her the purse which she angrily throws to the ground and indignantly leaves him. Nathan stands for the moment perplexed, then puts the gold in his own pocket, takes the empty purse, returns in the house, and shows the purse minus the gold.

Five years elapse, and outside Rudolph's home he and Madalene and their little child are seated. Leah comes upon the little girl and kisses the child lovingly. The villagers come upon the pair and jeer at the Jewess. The noise brings Rudolph and Madalene from the house, and Leah points to Nathan, the leader of the mob, denounces him as an apostate Jew, a thief and the instigator of her unhappiness. Rudolph shows the empty purse, justifying the charge. Nathan is taken in hand by officers and dragged away.

So the trains, of which there was but one a day, are never on time. To the station there comes a coterie of weary travelers, all possessed with a wild desire to put a long distance between Lonesome Junction and the backs of their necks. As usual, the train is six hours late, and you may imagine the party is in not a very amiable humor. The first to arrive is an Englishman, who is \"jolly well\" vexed at the condition of affairs. \"Train six hours late! Hit's a blooming h'outrage, don't you know!\" He leaves his suit case in the sway of others coming in, and a wealthy mine owner, who enters at that moment, falls sprawling. The next to enter is a prize-fighter, who in turn takes a tumble. Wow! It looks as if there is going to be \"something doing,\" when the driver of the Pony Express enters with the mail bag, and tells Mr. Pug to sit down and behave. He sits and lights his pipe, still chewing the rag. The driver clips the pipe out of his mouth with a pistol shot and makes him dance to the music of his gun play. This holds Mr. Pug for an indefinite period. The party is now increased by the arrival of Heinrich Spitzelperger. \"Vas ist das; sex stunden zu warten ? Oh, vell, I haf a smoke.\" Heine has pipe and tobacco, but no match. \"Please, you haf a match, no?\" Well, it looks as if he don't smoke. At this point the door opens and in rushes one of those hypochondriacal phisanthropists, a Black Hand Dago. A hyena is a playful kitten compared with him. Opening his satchel, he takes out a large bomb, lights the fuse and places it on the window shelf of the ticket office. The pugilist is the first to notice his action and yells, \"Beat it!\" which they surely do, all except Heine, who is seated on a bench still searching through his pockets in hopes of finding a match hidden therein. Espying the smoking fuse of the bomb, he picks it up, ignorant of the danger, lights his pipe and failing to extinguish it, drops it into a fire pail none too soon, for the moment it strikes the water it explodes, blowing Heine off his feet. When the party returns they find him suffering no further injury than badly shattered nerves. While relating his experience there enters a most beautiful young lady. \"Observe who is in our midst,\" says one, and a more chivalrous bunch you never saw; all anxious to serve her. She states that her baggage is outside, so Mr. Pug insists that \"I'm de boy wit de strong arm.\" He carries in several grips and finally a trunk as big as a cottage, which completely does him up, and though there is still another trunk, he is not equal to it. Now Heine gives an exhibition of brain vs. brawn, and instead of shouldering the trunk, wheels it in on a hand truck, much to the amusement of the party at the expense of the pugilist. They are all now in high spirits when there appears in the doorway a tough road agent With most forbidding mien he points a revolver and commands them to line up and put their valuables on the floor in front of him. Heine, unobserved by the bad man, drops down behind the trunk and when the thug's back is turned, sticks a gun behind his ear and tells him to drop his firearm on the top of the trunk. Hurrah for Heine, the hero! But he forgets the thug may have another gun, and in the unguarded moment he whips out another and is about to push daylight through Dutchy when the express driver from outside sends a bullet through the bad boy's wrist. The arrival of the belated train is announced, and the party scramble out of the station, in a mad rush to get aboard."},"Macbeth":{"title":"Macbeth","plot":"Macbeth, the Thane of Glamis, receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland.

He eked his existence by fishing, hunting and mining, having a small claim which he clandestinely worked, hiding his gains in the trunk of an old tree. It is needless to say that he was beloved by those few who knew him, among whom was a little boy, who was his almost constant companion. One day he took the little fellow to his deposit vault, the tree trunk, and showed him the yellow nuggets he had dug from the earth, presenting him with a couple of them. In the camp there were a couple of low-down human coyotes, who would rather steal than work. They had long been anxious to find the hiding place of the Indian's wealth, so capture the boy, and by beating and torture compel him to disclose its whereabouts. In the meantime there has come to the place a couple of surveyors who enlist the services of the Indian to guide them to the hilltop. Here they arrive, set up their telescope and start calculations. An idea strikes them to allow the Indian to look through the 'scope. He is amazed at the view, so close does it bring the surrounding country to him. While his eye is at the glass one of the surveyors slowly turns it on the revolving head until the Indian starts back with an expression of horror, then looks again, and with a cry of anguish dashes madly away down the mountain side, for the view was enough to freeze the blood in his veins. Arriving at the old tree trunk, his view through the telescope is verified, for there is the result he improvised bank rifled, and the old grandfather of the little boy, who had followed the miscreants murdered. Picking the old man up he carries his lifeless form back to the camp, reaching there just after the murderers, with the boy, had decamped in a canoe. Laying the body on the sands and covering it tenderly with his shawl he stands over it and solemnly vows to be avenged. What a magnificent picture he strikes as he stands there, his tawny skin silhouetted against the sky, with muscles turgid and jaws set in grim determination. It is but for a moment he stands thus, yet the pose speaks volumes. Turning quickly, he leaps into a canoe at the bank and paddles swiftly after the fugitives. On, on goes the chase, the Indian gaining steadily on them, until at last abandoning hope, they leave their canoe and try to wade to shore as the Indian comes up. Leaping from his boat he makes for the pair, seizing one as the other swims to the opposite shore. Clutching him by the throat the Indian forces his head beneath the surface of the water and holds it there until life is extinct, after which he dashes in pursuit of the other. This proves to be a most exciting swimming race for a life. They reach the other shore almost simultaneously, and a ferocious conflict takes place on the sands terminating in the Indian forcing his adversary to slay himself with his own dagger. Having now fulfilled his vow he leaps into the water and swims back to the canoe in which sits the terrified boy, and as night falls he paddles slowly back to camp."},"Rescued from an Eagle's Nest":{"title":"Rescued from an Eagle's Nest","plot":"A woodcutter says good-bye to his wife and child, and then goes off to work.

No one was in the house but the baby and nurse, both of whom are now abed. There is no trace or sign of the entrance of a thief. How did it happen? Well, the detectives are summoned and put to work on the case, but without success, although a reward of $10,000 is offered for the apprehension of the robbers and return of the jewels. The detectives finally give the matter up. Poor Jenkins is certainly up against it, for the loss of the jewels is the beginning of a streak of wretched luck. He is beaten on all sides in the stock market until at length he is forced to the wall. Poverty, disgrace and even starvation stare him and his loved ones in the face. Forced to sell his house and then the furniture to satisfy his creditors, he is in the depths of despair as he stands and views his precious little one playing on the floor with her doggie, unconscious of the anguish of her father. Piece by piece the household effects are seized, until there remains but a couple of chairs, on one of which Baby places her doggie. At that moment the door opens and Smithson, Jenkins' friend, enters to offer his sympathy and aid. Smithson is a good hearted, blustering fellow, and in the enthusiasm of his friendship, flusters about, finally throwing himself into the only chair in the room, not noticing the toy, of course crushing it to atoms. Leaping to his feet, he is profuse in apologies, when, lo and behold! there among the fragments of the broken dog lay the diamonds. The clouds that hung over the household are dissipated and the little family may start anew. There are many sensational incidents in the course of the film, one showing the curb market of New York is most unique."},"Knight of Black Art":{"title":"Knight of Black Art","plot":"We are introduced to the banqueting hall of an old-time castle.

He resided luxuriously in bachelor apartments, surrounded by a coterie of agreeable companions. His social duties were that exigent as to prevent his working for a livelihood. Still the money must come from somewhere, so Reggie devised a scheme. His nearest kin and benefactor was an uncle, the Rev. Eben Haddock, who had often, in Reggie's extreme youth, lent a helping hand. The old gentleman was of a benevolent nature and Reggie felt sure of the successful outcome of his plan. Knowing that the old man's most ardent wish was that he, Reggie, should marry and settle down, he writes him that he had at last taken a wife, and of course Reggie's allowance was increased. This, in time, proved inadequate to his mode of living, and a second letter was dispatched that his reverence had been made a grand uncle, and another increase in the allowance was made. For two years everything went well, and Reggie was certainly tearing off the very best this old world affords. Nothing to do but spend Nunky's money. However, there came a jolt one morning, when Reggie receives a letter from his uncle stating he would arrive in New York that day for the sole purpose of seeing the wife and baby. \"Good heavens.

Timothy Tubbs, the valet, comes to his rescue, and suggests that Mrs. Tubbs play the wife. \"Fine, hut how about the kid?\" \"We'll have her bring along a baby.\" The scheme looked good, and Reggie telephones to the valet's wife to come to the apartments at once and bring a baby. Mrs. Tubbs, not unduly bright, thinks he means her own baby, a boy of fourteen. Meanwhile, the Rev. Eben Haddock has arrived and is anxious to see the family, but excuses are made, until at last Mrs. Tubbs dashes in with her boy. She is a sight, still Reggie must make the best of it: but it is out of the question to palm a fourteen-year-old boy off as a two-year-old infant, so Mrs. Tubbs is introduced as Mrs. Reggie Van Twiller and \"Buttons,\" the hallboy, is hustled to the orphan asylum to procure an infant. While uncle is shocked at the sight and manners of the pretended wife, he is annoyingly anxious to see the baby. Excuses are made that it is out with the nurse, and will be hack shortly. At last the word is given that baby is here, for \"Buttons\" has returned. Reggie at last breathes freely, but his case is of short duration, for the asylum nurse enters with the infant, and uncovering its face, one look was enough: \"Great Jupiter, it's a coon!\" Likely enough, for the order simply said \"a two-year-old infant,\" with no mention of race or color. Reggie feels that his meal ticket is irretrievably punched, so you may imagine his surprise when he sees that his uncle is not only amused at what he considers a great joke on Reggie, but greatly relieved to know that the awful freak was only a make-believe wife."},"The Vaquero's Vow":{"title":"The Vaquero's Vow","plot":"Manuella, a beautiful Mexican girl, is the object of the pure, honest affections of Renaldo, a poor Vaquero, and while she is touched by his tender attentions, she shows a decided preference for Gonzales, a dashing young musician, who, being the beau ideal of the senoritas 'round about, hence Manuella feels immeasurably flattered by his advances.

We see the circus arrive, to the great joy of the villagers. Then we see the little girl carried on her couch out of the wagon. As the film is unreeled we witness a varied and interesting circus performance. The clown, as usual, being the cause of hilarity. There are acrobatic turns by clever performers and some wonderful tricks done by extremely well trained animals. The effect upon the assembled villagers is interesting to note, the clown's work eliciting the greatest applause. We, who are by means of the camera permitted to witness the other side of the clown's life in the interior of his home, see the suffering and parental anxiety of the man. This is the whole theme of the picture. The poor fellow, faithful to his work, goes through his act with well-simulated gaiety and enthusiasm, though his heart is breaking from fear and anxiety over his little girl. In addition to worrying over the illness of one child, a little incident, which occurs in the circus ring, shows that the father has a watchful eye where his pretty elder daughter is concerned. The ending of the picture is a happy one and we see the departure of the circus. The man who has interested us leaves for new fields with a happy smile that is not altogether assumed. The picture should not fail to amuse the children, and the blending of comedy and pathos is sure to carry weight with the older people."},"The Heart of a Cowboy":{"title":"The Heart of a Cowboy","plot":"Two handsome young Americans, cowboys of the \"Bar O\" ranch, fall in love with Kitty Blair, the pretty daughter of a neighboring ranchman.

Howard manfully withdraws, after shaking hands with Bronson and wishing the two a happy life together. It is not long, however, before Bronson shows the other side of his nature. Bronson loses money gambling and plans to reimburse himself by appropriating another ranchman's cattle. Bronson takes into his confidence one Will Parsons, another cowpuncher, and when night falls they visit the corral and make away with a half-dozen of the ranchman's choicest steers.

In the meantime discovery of the theft is made, and a photograph of Kitty, bearing the legend, \"To my friend Steve,\" is found close to the spot where the cattle were rounded up. A visit to Steve Howard's adobe follows, but Howard's entire ignorance of the entire affair seems to point out his innocence. There can be but one other Steve who could be guilty, and Bronson is hunted up. He is apprised at his sweetheart's home, accused of the theft, and is about to be led away to the lynching tree, when Howard, who has come upon the scene, steps in front of Bronson and shoulders the guilt himself. Bronson is thunderstruck but does not offer to interfere when Howard is led away. He is not quite capable in his black soul of appreciating the nobleness of Howard's sacrifice. On the other hand Howard is firmly convinced that Bronson is innocent and it is to make happy the girl he loves in taking Bronson's place. Bronson, after the party has left, turns to the girl and begs her to go East with him. She consents and goes into the house to pack her suitcase.

This traitorous redskin is elated at the opportunity to perpetrate a long cherished revenge. To this effect he has notified his followers and they stand in readiness to act at his call. Proceeding on their journey, they come to a mountain stream, where the party rest and take water, Big Serpent and the scout leading the horses into the shade of the wood. Just prior to the party's arrival, Leather Stocking and Uncas meet, and when they learn Big Serpent is guiding the party, they express their misgivings, being sure of his sinister intention, and truly, for while they are indicating their fears, the scout rushes on and tells that he had been assaulted and the horses killed. Leather Stocking and Uncas volunteer to see the party through their danger, if possible, but they have not proceeded far when the woods seem alive with Indians and the party is almost surrounded. Taking the only avenue of retreat, they manage to reach the stockade just ahead of the bloodthirsty Indians. Here a spirited battle ensues, which is not destined to last long, as ammunition is low. It is hoping against hope, for we now find there are but two charges left, and after that they will be at the mercy of the foe. Leather Stocking, however, feels that there is but one chance, hazardous though it be, of getting to the fort for aid. His plan is subtle in the extreme. Donning an animal's skin, he plunges into the swirly, tortuous river at the back of the stockade, knowing that the crafty Indians would waste no ammunition on game, but save it for the enemy, ammunition being a scarce and precious commodity. In this manner he succeeds in reaching the soldiers' quarters, where he falls, exhausted, after telling them of the danger of the party. The soldiers start off at once, and are none too soon, for in the meantime the Indians have effected an entrance into the stockade with battering rams and have the party tied up to trees, piling brush to incinerate them. The torch is already applied to the brush about Uncas, and only the timely arrival of the soldiers and annihilation of the redskins saves his life. Uncas then accompanies the party on their way to the brow of the bill, where we leave him standing alone, the last of the Mohicans."},"A Woman of the People":{"title":"A Woman of the People","plot":"Eve S. takes lunch to her father, who is working at Mr. Young's factory. By chance the young and handsome manufacturer sees her; he falls in love with her, and after a short talk tries to kiss her.

He is working with an invention, which he believes will give him lots of money, but just now the family is very poor, and to procure the necessary money for food S. has to go to a pawnbroker with his best suit of clothes. Eve is working hard all day with the sewing machine in order to procure a little money for the household. She is interrupted at her work by a boy who brings a letter from Mr. Young asking her to meet him only for a few minutes. She cannot help granting him the request, as the handsome manufacturer has made a stronger impression on the young girl than she likes to confess. A few minutes later the two young people take a walk together, and all scruples are forgotten. He kisses her again and again, and Eve does not make any objections, till at last she finds herself alone with several banknotes in her hand which Mr. Young has given her. Later Mr. Young celebrates his betrothal with a rich and beautiful young lady. The festival is interrupted by S., who appears, using very strong language to Mr. Young, and flings his money right in his face. But the vulgar person is turned out, and the feast is continued. S. soon after gets his invention sold and becomes a rich man. One day the little family learns that Mr. Young's factory is burned down, and the manufacturer totally ruined, through not having had the insurance policy duly renewed. Eve had not been able to forget Mr. Young, and she now persuades her father to go to him and offer him partnership, but although the young man is ruined and left by everybody, even his intended bride, he is too proud to accept the noble offer, so that S. comes back without having accomplished his errand. But now Eve takes the matter in her own hands. She goes once more to the man she loves to propose partnership with her father, and this time Mr. Young has to submit, for Eve offers him not only her father's money, but her own honest heart and her hand as well."},"Lady Helen's Escapade":{"title":"Lady Helen's Escapade","plot":"Prizes gained without effort are never valuable, and, though we don't appreciate it, the longing for something makes existence sweet; hence if one has everything there is nothing to long for. Such was the condition of Lady Helen, who had everything she could wish for, and in consequence felt very much bored. In her ennui she longs for excitement, for some new sensation, but in vain, until looking over the newspaper she is seized with an irresistible inclination of going out to work, so incognito engages as a domestic in a boarding house. Here she makes a ludicrous attempt to cook, etc., and of course, being totally ignorant of the culinary art, meets with meagre success. However, her pretty face and ill-concealed refinement make such a strong impression upon the male contingent, that they make no complaints at her cooking, and would have taken even poison if served by her fair hands. Two hallroom boys are particularly smitten. Among the boarders there is a talented musician, and his gentle manners and wonderful talent appeal strongly to Lady Helen. He on the other hand, not knowing of course her true self, falls in love with her. All this is most agreeable to the women folks, who at once conspire to rid the place of her, which one brings about by having her accused of the theft of the musician's violin. He, of course, believes her innocent, but she is discharged nevertheless. Lady Helen is so moved by the poor fellow's kindness, that she interests herself in his behalf and secures for him a position as a director at the Conservatory, for which he calls to thank her and finding her a lady of quality would shrink humbly from her presence, but she will not let him for she too loves him. The subject as a whole is a decidedly amusing comedy drama, with a pretty love story running through it."},"The Light That Came":{"title":"The Light That Came","plot":"A disfigured young woman with two beautiful sisters is courted by a blind man.

Hence it is when Isabelle appears on the scene clad in a gown that is a masterpiece of the dressmaker's art she easily fascinates the male contingent, among whom is Enrico, the sweetheart of Veronica, a street singer. Enrico is so enraptured at the sight of Isabelle in her resplendent attire that he becomes her abject slave, casting aside the poor, peasant-clad little Italian street singer, who has loved him devotedly. Crushed almost beyond endurance the poor girl stands sobbing at the entrance of the park where the inconsistent lever left her. Her tears attract the attention of a wealthy young couple who happen to pass. In answer to their queries she tells them how contemptibly her sweetheart acted, and all because of the fascinating influence of a gown. The lady is moved to commiseration and offers her aid in the gift of the most beautiful gown Veronica has ever seen. Her opportunity for revenge has turned her love to hate, and as she appears at the Italian Benevolent Association ball, she is the star of the event, for she looks like a queen as she promenades the ball room. She at once becomes the \"Mrs. Trouble\" of the evening, for the men all desert their partners and flock around her, beseeching but a smile. All this elicits from the women folk delicate little bon-mots such as \"Hussy.\" \"Temptress.\" \"Cat,\" \"False hair.\" \"Paints.\" Oh, well, you know how it is. Enrico is thrown into a rage that runs the entire gamut of emotions, love, jealousy, hate, disappointment and a few others, too numerous to mention here.

Still she will not trust him and turns to a poor good-hearted Italian who has persistently loved her despite her coldness."},"Lucky Jim":{"title":"Lucky Jim","plot":"Jim Dixon feels anything but lucky.

Buonaparte, then an impecunious young officer, the subject soon introduces us to Madame Sans Gene, Who brings Napoleon his washing and submits to a kiss. Later, in the laundry itself, her rescue of Count Neupport, whom she assists in a wounded state to her own bedroom, is shown. The girl's lover, Sergeant Le Fevre, forces an entrance, but lets the prisoner go to shield his sweetheart. These scenes all contain much effective acting, as does a later one in which the sergeant is instrumental in saving Napoleon's life. The latter has taken the place of a sentry who has fallen asleep at his post and resting on the latter's ride is waiting for him to wake, when a number of Royalist soldiers attack him. Le Fevre, on his rounds, comes to the rescue and secures a pardon for the sentry and promotion for himself. Le Fevre's rise is rapid. Made a field-marshal, he, after the battle of Danzig, is made a duke for his gallantry in saving the colors. At this stage we are given another glimpse of the heroine, who follows her husband's fortunes in the camp. This period introduces some good scenes of camp life, the council of officers, etc. Back at Paris, we find Napoleon in his private cabinet, unaware of an intrigue in progress in which the Empress is concerned, having for its object the escape of Count Neupport, who is entrusted with a letter to the Emperor of Austria.

Then they repair together to Napoleon and confess what they have done, to be magnanimously forgiven by the Emperor, after a natural outburst of anger, when he remembers that he owes his life to the man."},"A Maid of the Mountains":{"title":"A Maid of the Mountains","plot":"A drama of the mountains of Switzerland."},"Mamma":{"title":"Mamma","plot":"About a young film critic who dream of interviewing actor Jean Gabin and Jean-Louis Barrault and one day directing a movie."},"A Man with Three Wives":{"title":"A Man with Three Wives","plot":"The location of this picture is not in Utah as might be inferred from the title, but right here in New York; and the situation is not so serious as it sounds. Jack Howard who, with his chum Ralph, occupies a pretty studio in the Artists' Quarters, has just been married and some vague rumor of the event has reached the ears of his Uncle Peter. Now, Uncle Peter is a man of millions and Jack is his heir; and, like many other men of affairs, Uncle Peter considers it among his prerogatives to decide the domestic future of his lawful heir. He, therefore, sends Jack a peremptory telegram forbidding him to marry, under penalty of disinheritance. As Jack has already committed that indiscretion it is too late to obey the command so, when Uncle Peter announces that he is coming for himself to see about things, the situation becomes desperate; but Jack is a young man of resource and, despite the fact that Ralph has a wife and baby, he insists upon introducing his bride to Uncle Peter as the lawful spouse of Ralph. Jack's mother-in-law has a constitutional objection to models in her son-in-law's studio, so when she discovers one posing there, Jack sees no way out of the dilemma except to introduce the model as Ralph's wife, thus presenting Ralph with his third spouse. Things might have gone very smoothly under such circumstances, but for the fact that, to Uncle Peter. Ralph must appear to have one wife, and to Jack's mother-in-law, another; and must keep the situation from his own lawful wife. How thoroughly things get mixed when the different members of the families arrive together at the studio can better be told by the film than by words. The denouement is happy, however, as well as hilariously funny. The uncle falls a victim to the charms of Jack's wife and, gallantly accepting the inevitable when he is informed of the true state of affairs, he turns his attention to the model whom he embraces in his enthusiasm. Ralph's wife is pacified too, after an effort, in fact, everybody catches the spirit of the occasion, and joins in the hilarity except the mother-in-law, around whom they all dance ring-o-rosey, to her complete discomfiture."},"The Maniac Cook":{"title":"The Maniac Cook","plot":"N/A"},"The Message":{"title":"The Message","plot":"In the 7th century, Mohammed, Peace Be Upon Him, is visited by Angel Gabriel who urges him to lead the people of Mecca and worship God.

As Mrs. Ross is dressed and ready to attend an afternoon tea at Mrs. Parker's, this forced absence of the nurse is very inopportune. However, little Alice. Mrs. Ross's seven-year-old daughter, is a bright child, so she feels that she can trust her to look after her grandma, and give her the medicine at the regular intervals. Mrs. Ross, herself, is suffering from a painful abrasion on her hand, for which she has procured an antiseptic to bathe it with, which is a deadly poison.

The poor woman is beside herself in fearful helplessness, when Mrs. Parker suggests the telephone. This she tries, and she is put in further trepidation at her inability to get connection, for at Central the operators are too busy chatting to take notice.

Little Bear and Rising Moon hearing their approach endeavor to make their escape. Pushing their way towards the river bank, with Standing Rock and his braves following, they leap into a canoe and are soon dashing along in the swift current of the mountain stream, which is in places the most dangerous of rapids. The feat seems ominous, but is safely accomplished, and was worthy of a better fate than capture, which they were later. Death of both is the reward, and they are bound together to this end. The ire of Standing Rock demanded more than mere death, so he proceeds to taunt and torture his rival. This is received with such stoicism by Little Bear, that Standing Rock is amazed to the point of admiration for the brave's fortitude, and not only cuts the cords that bind him, but bestows upon him the Eagle Feather, the highest honored gift to the brave, and bids he and Rising Moon to go and may they be happy.

However, by a clever trick, Senorita rights the impending wrong; the soldier escapes without a scar, and the sweethearts are left enjoying their cigarettes.

It is a surprise to him, being possessed of such rare merit, that he sends a check to Woodson, with word that he will be glad to consider anything else he may write.

The pursuers are joined by the person disturbed, and the culprit is again forced to make the fire-escape. In and out the windows, on and off the fire-escape, the unfortunate burglar is pursued by the ever-increasing mob, through the hallways, knocking everyone down that comes between him and his freedom. At last his Nemesis appears in the shape of a bulldog, who follows him with a persistency that brings about his capture. A German policeman figures prominently in the picture, also a gentleman about to take a bath. The following crowd is dressed in a variety of costumes that adds greatly to the comical events.

All the employees are busy at their appointed tasks, except the youthful playwright, who snatches time to re-read one of his earliest efforts. The door opens and the Italian comedian, Scaramouche, enters in quest of a particular style of chair. Moliere tenders his play for perusal; but, just as Scaramouche begins to be interested, Poquelin, the father of Moliere, comes in unexpectedly and the play is hastily thrown out of sight. Again the boy poet places it in the comedian's hand, and some clever work is done by Scaramouche, as he tries to read the manuscript without being detected by the stern upholsterer. The next scene shows Moliere at the Louvre palace, where he meets Louis XIV for the first time. Here we see the scorn of the courtiers for the actor-dramatist and the consideration shown for him by the King. This scene will be remembered for the delicate beauty of the interiors shown. Next we view the stately splendor of the festival at Versailles, where hundreds of courtiers, ladies in waiting and great nobles attend on Louis XIV. The beauty of the court costumes, which set the fashion for all the royal houses in Europe at that time, and the courtly air and demeanor of every individual in the royal pageant, have been faithfully reproduced. One cannot but marvel at the excellence of the training of this vast throng, every one of whom acts his or her part as if manor-born. We must take off our hats to this Gaumont producer. As Moliere comes into the scene, the acting of the King, the courtiers and of the great actor himself, is faultless. When the King places his arm around Moliere's shoulders and walks off with him, it is a delight to watch the faces of the surprised and jealous train of followers. And when next we see Louis seated at table with Moliere, serving him with his own hands, the cup of the courtiers is full. The scene showing the distraction of Moliere over the desertion of his wife is a pathetic picture and displays talented emotional acting. Then, when she appears before finally leaving him, and we watch the play of coquetry on her witching face and note her charm of manner and grace of deportment, we do not wonder at poor Moliere's abandonment to despair. The attempt of the faithful maid servant to arouse Moliere from his apathy and melancholia is a brilliant specimen of silent acting in both roles. The last appearance of Moliere, and his first in the role of Malade, is a fine depiction of the stage of the tennis court theater and of the French manner of acting a part in the seventeenth century. Then follow his sudden illness and death."},"The Mountaineer's Honor":{"title":"The Mountaineer's Honor","plot":"A mountain girl is seduced by a traveler from the valley.

The league arranges to attend a three-days' convention out of town, and when Mrs. Jones departs, Jones sends a note to Smith, telling him to bring the gang, and they would have a \"Prayer Meeting,\" enjoining him not to forget the \"fixings.\" Well, the gang are not long in putting in an appearance, for they feel that every minute's delay is a chunk lost from a golden opportunity for fun. Of \"fixing\" there is much, and it isn't long before they are in the \"Wild Indian\" stage of inebriety. During this time the feminine nemesis of Rum, the League has arrived at the station just in time to see the train pull out. Madder than wet hens, they decide to pass the night with Mrs. Jones. \"Oh, horror! Oh horror! a couple of times.\" Does not your sympathetic heart go out to poor unsuspecting Jones who in the meantime has gotten into a glorious condition, and the gang dress him in one of his wife's gowns, paint his face, carry him to the bedroom and throw him into bed, covering him up with the bedclothes. At this moment the prohibition party are seen approaching the house. The men hide as best they can the \"fixings,\" and are sitting reading books entitled \"Down with Rum\" when the ladies enter. They of course are delighted at this sight, and the absence of Jones is explained by a faked note calling him to attend a sick friend, noble Jones. The ladies go to the bedroom to remove their wraps, and their intrusion arouses Jones, who, not recognizing them, makes a dash for them, at which they all rush wildly into the drawing room, screaming that there is a madman in the bedroom. The men then rush in and while pretending to annihilate the imagined maniac they tidy up Jones and slip him through the window, that he may go around and enter the front door. The fright attending this episode has somewhat sobered him and everything would have been well had not Mrs. J. got a whiff of his breath. Even this would have passed, but Sister Anderson spies the bottles. Well, it's all off. It looks bad for Jones until the gang step forward and claim all the blame, as Jones was not even present. Here Jones makes the bluff and exclaims majestically. \"Madam, nimium de crede colori!\" or, in other words, \"Trust not to appearances.\" and the bluff goes."},"Jones' Burglar":{"title":"Mr. Jones' Burglar","plot":"Everything on this old mundane sphere has its use.

However, Billy's record is getting too strong for even the sheriff of the county and a posse is organized to take the bad man in his lair. Yet Billy does not lack friends, as is evidenced by the following note from an unknown friend: \"Friend Broncho: The Vigilantes Committee suspect you of cattle rustling. The sheriff is on your trail. You will stretch a hemp if you are caught. A Friend.\" Words go a long way in the west, and Billy, who has received the note at his shack, hurriedly saddles his pony and rides away.

In the wagon an old man is lying and he is informed by the girl that her \"daddy\" is sick.

However, he takes the prescription and says that if he cannot find another messenger he will go himself. Billy rides off and comes across a Mexican. He explains to the latter and asks him to go to town for the medicine. The Mexican's eyes twinkle when he sees the silver and he nods his head, but as Broncho Billy rides away he tears the prescription into bits, pockets the money and goes away exultantly. Some time later Billy passes a herd of cattle and the old desire to rustle takes the better of him. But as he is stealing off with the bunch he again comes across the prairie schooner and believing something to be wrong crosses over to it. It is empty and the horses, with the lines under their feet, are cropping the grass. Broncho turns the cattle loose, dismounts from his nag and mounts the seat of the wagon.

Under the intense strain of caring for her father and assuming command of the caravan, she, too, has fallen ill. Broncho Billy curses the thieving Mexican who had stolen the money, carries the two into the wagon, and mounting the seat, whips the horses into a gallop. Some time later he draws up in town, jumps from the wagon and throws up his hands as the guns of the sheriff and his posse are leveled at his head. He indicates the wagon and the two sick persons are taken out and carried into the doctor's office. Then he turns to the sheriff and holds out his hands, but this officer of the peace hesitates about putting the handcuffs on his captive and finally ends by telling Billy he is free if he will promise to mend his ways.

He, poor youth, still conscious of that word \"betrayer.\" the last that his friend had called him, expects further rebuke, but he is mistaken, for with a smile of benediction, Standish takes the hand of the maid and the hand of the youth, and joining them, smiles his approbation of two well met, well loved, and well united."},"The Cowboy's Sweetheart":{"title":"The Cowboy's Sweetheart","plot":"N/A"},"A Cowboy's Vindication":{"title":"A Cowboy's Vindication","plot":"Will and Frank Morrison, brothers, are working their mother's extensive ranch and while Frank is manly and upright, Will is a dissipated gambler and drunkard.

They decried any ebullition her youth might induce, and frowned into silence her joyous ringing laughter. This condition told on her and she longed for life's radiant sunshine, love. It comes at last. Allen Edwards, a concert singer, while driving his auto in the neighborhood of the old Quaker's farm, meets with a serious accident, and is carried to the Southcomb homestead. He is in such a condition that he cannot be removed to his home for some time, and hence is cared for by the Southcomb family, although the old man openly expresses his aversion for the young man on account of the profession. An attachment springs up between Ann and Allen which ripens into sincere love. The old man is beside himself with rage when they broach the subject of marriage. But Ann is decided and the old man, though he loves his daughter, haughtily drives her from the house, for when pride begins love ceases. He stubbornly refuses to have anything further to do with her. He becomes so bitter that he erases her name from the family Bible. To him she is as dead. Many a heartache does the young wife suffer, though Allen has tried time and time again to effect a reconciliation, until one day they receive word that the old Sonthcomb farm had been seized for debt and the couple were forced to go to the poorhouse. What a shock this is to the young couple! It is the old story of pride defeating its own end by bringing the man who seeks esteem into contempt. The young people make their way to the poorhouse, where the old father is seen scrubbing floors, while the mother bends over a washtub. They are brought to the office to interview their disowned daughter, but the old man is still adamant and while the mother is inclined to accept Ann's protection the father stubbornly refuses, going back with hauteur to his scrub pail. Ann now realizes that something more than bare persuasion must be resorted to, and as she views through the half open door her parents' sad plight, an idea strikes her. Seating herself at the organ, she plays and sings her father's favorite hymn. The sound of the music halts the old man in his work, and he crawls sobbing to the door to hear the better. Ann continues to play and sing until it at last he staggers up to be folded in her arms. He now realizes how unreasonable he has been, not only to her, but to her mother and himself."},"Her Photograph":{"title":"Her Photograph","plot":"The trouble began owing to Mr. Gayman's infatuation for a vaudeville star, who, in the due course of events, presented him with a photograph of herself in a part that required her to wear a dress that began low above and finished high below.

How could the theme of this film be accomplished if little Willie and his big brother playing leapfrog outside had not found it and naturally took it home with them, where their papa quickly confiscated it?

At length an idea strikes him. He is an expert gambler and will go to the parlor and try his luck. He enters the game, just as his brother-in-law, whom he does not know, is enjoying a streak of good fortune. He has hardly started before things begin to come his way, and at last the game is between him and his brother-in-law, the others having drawn out. Being an experienced gambler, never losing his nerve, he has the best of it. It is a desperate battle, ending with the Westerner in possession of all the chips. The poor husband staggers home, and driven to the wall, is about to finish it all in the conventional way, when the Westerner enters. Each now sees who his vis-à-vis was, and the young man is able to make restitution, but he loses his position, for he has lost the reputation of trustworthiness. The Westerner, however, is prosperous and promises to assist him, at the same time impressing him with the criminal folly of gambling."},"The Lady and the Burglar":{"title":"The Lady and the Burglar","plot":"Professor Blackburn is an eminent lecturer, a man well past middle age. He has married a beautiful and charming young woman of whom he is deeply enamored. The young wife is very fond of the Professor, but he is so engrossed in his studies and the preparation of lectures on Egyptian hieroglyphics that he does not respond sufficiently to the ardent devotion of his wife. Mrs. Blackburn is constantly importuned by a previous suitor whom she had rejected, and though she declines at all times to listen to the handsome Lothario, she refrains from telling her husband anything about his advances. An automobile accident happens one day which has a great effect upon the domestic affairs of the Blackburns. A little girl is badly injured in the accident and Mrs. Blackburn picks her up and carries her to the child's home. There she meets the father of the child, a man of poor circumstances, whose appearance would indicate that he is of the lower strata of life. Mrs. Blackburn places the child upon the little cot in her room and sends one of the neighbors for a doctor and a nurse. When they arrive she makes arrangements with them for the care of the child, and instructs them to leave nothing undone for the comfort and welfare of the little one. We now go back to the Blackhurns. One day Mrs. Blackburn is waiting in the park for her husband to come along, when Ainsley, the rejected suitor, passes, sees her and accosts her. The Professor coming to the place of meeting, sees his wife in conversation with a handsome stranger, and for the first time in their married life jealousy finds a place in his heart. Mrs. Blackburn does not tell the Professor who the handsome stranger is, fearing to arouse the very sentiment which has, unknown to her, begun to tear the Professor's heart. The suspicions of the Professor are deepened when on entering the parlor one day he finds Mrs. Blackburn hastily concealing between the pages of a book a letter which she has just received from Ainsley. Mrs. Blackburn is angered at the reception of this letter, but does not tell the Professor anything about it. While the Professor's mind is tossed between varied emotions of love and jealousy he receives a call to deliver a lecture out of town. He bids Mrs. Blackburn good-bye. It is evening, and as the Professor leaves his home a rough-looking character, none other than the man whose child was befriended by Mrs. Blackburn, watches him as he walks away. The man's attitude indicates that he intends to burglarize the house. He steals around the back way and enters the rear window. While Dykes, the burglar, is filling his sack with the silverware in the dining room, Robert Ainsley calls. He is repulsed and asked to go. He refuses. While this scene is going on the Professor, who has forgotten a couple of books, returns to the house, enters the library and hears some discussion going on in the other room. His jealous mind immediately forms the conclusion that Mrs. Blackburn is untrue to him. Now we see Dykes, who is leaving the dining room and entering the parlor. He is on the scene when Mrs. Blackburn and Ainsley are in a heated discussion, and when he recognizes Mrs. Blackburn he tries to help her out of the dilemma. When the Professor drops a book in his excitement in the next room, Mrs. Blackburn realizes that her husband is at home and tries to get Ainsley away. She is afraid of his stepping into the hallway for fear that he would meet the Professor, and she is afraid of telling the Professor of his presence for fear that he might be unjustifiably jealous. She is in a quandary what to do, when Dykes, the burglar, steps forward, places his gun to the breast of the undesirable Ainsley and tells him to leave the house in the manner that he (Dykes) entered. This Ainsley does. Telling Mrs. Blackburn to trust him, Dykes places his pistol on a chair and pretends to take her necklace from her throat. The Professor enters and is surprised at not finding what he expected. He quickly rushes to his wife's aid. Seizing the revolver he forces Dykes to throw up his hands. The Professor backs toward the telephone on the table. Mrs. Blackburn now realizes that the man who has saved her is going to be captured. Her quick wit saves the situation. By a clever ruse she effects the escape of Dykes. This is not a great worry to the Professor, for the fact that his jealousy was unfounded is the paramount consideration with him. A happy ending follows, the action of which is most convincingly and splendidly characterized by those involved in the scene."},"The Land of Oz":{"title":"The Land of Oz","plot":"New Year in Russian - controlled and ruthless element.

They are Lieutenant Robert Bright and Lieutenant Arthur Hartley, both graduates of West Point, where they had been rivals during their Academy Days. This rivalry, which had been friendly at West Point, became very bitter when they were both assigned to Col. Moore's post and met his attractive daughter, and the true nature of the two men began to assert itself. Under the influence of Cynthia's smiles, Hartley worked with a will, mastered the intricacies of frontier strategy, proved himself in several tight places, and won the respect and esteem of the Colonel. Bright, on the other hand, became surly and morose, drunk a great deal, and placed himself daily farther and farther away from Cynthia and the hope of winning her. Hartley took up the study of wireless telegraphy, so necessary to maneuvers in latter-day warfare, and perfected himself in it. He also taught it to Cynthia, and when they were bending over the sender, with the blue spark hissing and biting as it leaped through the air, with their heads in proximity and their hearts beating time to the mysterious dots and dashes of the Morse code, it was all that Hartley could do to keep from blurting out his deep love. The agony that Bob Bright would undergo, when he would see them thus together, can only be understood by one who has suffered from the pangs inflicted by the green-eyed monster, Jealousy. Hartley has invented portable wireless equipment which may be carried in one's pocket, and he repairs to a spot away from the fort to test the success of his invention. Cynthia is at the sender in the wireless room at the post, and receives his call. Distinctly there comes to her the query, \"Cynthia, are you there?\" and she flashes back the reply, \"Yes.\" Overjoyed at the success of his invention, Hartley is emboldened and flashes through the message, \"Cynthia, I love you.\" Cynthia receives the message O.K. but the ardent lover is surprised and chagrined when his receiver spells: \"Your instrument must be out of order.\" Hartley feels that he is successful in his love affairs, however, and Bright, with the eyes of jealousy, knows that he is. In this extremity, when he can stand it no longer, he resolves to destroy Hartley and conspires with a band of smugglers and desperadoes, who infest the frontier, to waylay Hartley, with the intention of killing him. This is done, but the revengeful Lieutenant cannot forbear a sight of his rival, and so accompanies the party who abduct Hartley. The latter realizes his fate, particularly as he is kicked and cuffed by Bright, but instead of being killed at once, he is allowed to suffer until sunrise of the following day. He is placed in the courtyard of an old ruin, from which it is impossible for him to escape, as his captors guard the entrances. By cutting the ropes on a jagged stone, he succeeds in freeing his hands, and taking the wireless instrument, which has been unmolested by the ignorant bandits, he sends Cynthia the well-known distress signal, \"C.Q.D.\" She receives a call but cannot locate it, but soon through the air come the words from Hartley, telling of his plight and the place of his incarceration. Bright is present, endeavoring to press his suit, and is annoyed by the call from the wireless machine, which he does not understand. Cynthia, as soon as she can get rid of her undesirable visitor, excuses herself and rushes to her father with the news. The latter immediately dispatches a troop of cavalry to the spot, and in a pitched battle the bandits are defeated and Hartley is rescued. Bright is not aware of the miscarriage of his plans, and has sought out Cynthia with the intention of again declaring his love.

One day the stage drives up and deposits a money box with Thaw with instructions from the general manager of the Great Eastern that it is to be held with him over night, adding that he must keep a careful watch as it is reported that Buck Brady, an outlaw, has been seen skulking in the vicinity of Thaw's store. When the box arrives Thaw's wife is very ill and Jim had just been preparing to ride for the country donor. He realizes that duty commands him to guard the money, while the love for his wife, who is dangerously ill, urges him to forsake his duty and ride for the doctor. The trust is partially met when his daughter volunteers to watch the place and defend it should Buck Brady and his band endeavor to force an entrance. Jim has been gone but an hour or so when a lonely cowboy rides up and dismounts at the Thaw store. He has come for provisions and his wonder and curiosity are aroused when his knockings at the door are unanswered. Inside, the girl, who believes the innocent cowboy to be Buck Brady and his band, is making preparations to protect the treasure. However, when she does open the door the cowboy finds himself looking into the barrel of a pisto1 and the glint of steel courage in the girl's eye informs him that beyond a doubt he will suffer death if he makes the least suspicious move. The girl commands him to enter a small room off the store and after disarming him closes the door and locks it securely. Another dreary hour passes and there is another knock at the door. The frightened girl starts nervously, then cautiously steals to a window and looks out. Three men, armed and whispering together, are loitering at the door. The girl slips a heavy bar into the door, looks at her pistols and makes ready to defend her treasure. Suddenly there is a battering at the door and the heavy panels burst from the door and a pistol is thrust through. The bar is lifted and the bolt shot back and the three desperadoes slip into the room. Against the three the girl sees she can do nothing, when suddenly the door to the side is thrown open, two shots are fired and the foremost bandit drops in a heap on the floor. The others are panic stricken and seek to retreat, but this is cut off by the stalwart form of Thaw, followed by the doctor, each with leveled pistols. The wounded bandit and the two captured ones are removed by the sheriff, who comes on the scene, and explanations follow. The cowboy tells his surprise at being held up by Jim's daughter and how he guessed at the truth when the real bandits appeared. The girl thankfully stretches out her hands to the cowboy and we may imagine that a love affair is well rooted."},"The Modern Prodigal":{"title":"The Modern Prodigal","plot":"In the opening of this subject we find the callow youth as he points towards the city's spires, exclaiming to his dear old mother, \"Mother, there in the big city is my sphere. There will I turn the world over.\" Off he goes cityward, ambitious and presumptuous, and perhaps we may add reckless. Alas, the city's whirl is quite a change from the simple quiet life in the country and the youth falls a victim to the snares that beset the unsophisticated. After a bitter experience he returns, and in symbolism we show him in the raiment of sin, a convict's suit. Approaching his old home, he sees there in front of the door the old chair in which sat his mother on the day of his depart. What a difference! On that day there shone the sunshine of hope; today, the clouds of despair. As he regards himself in his prison garb, he utters that penitential cry of the ancient prodigal, \"I am no more worthy to be called thy son.\" Turning away, he staggers exhausted to the pigsty, where he eats ravenously the husks upon which the swine feed. At this point we show the other side, the watchful father and his son. The father is the sheriff and has just received the notice of a convict's escape and a reward offered for his capture, the poor convict, meanwhile, being hounded from place to place by the pursuing guards. The sheriff's young son yields to temptation and is guilty of stealing apples and then lies about it. For this the father chastises him, so in the spirit of rebellion, he goes swimming with his playmates. Here he is guilty of disobedience and is made to suffer. Going beyond his depth, he is carried by the swift running current into the rapids. The boy's drowning seems inevitable, but the cries of his companions are heard by the fugitive, who is hiding in the bushes by the side of the stream, and at the risk of his life and liberty he plunges into the seething torrent and drags the child to safety just as the father having been informed of the child's peril. Here is an awkward situation. He is torn by conflicting inclinations. As father of the rescued boy, he owes the fugitive an immeasurable debt of gratitude, but as sheriff it is his duty to arrest the convict. Here is where duty is unreasonable. However, there is no compromise where duty is concerned, and he is forced to perform it, odious though it be. At his home he leaves the prisoner in charge of his wife while he gets his carriage. The mother allowing maternal love to guide her feelings, feigns sleep that the prisoner may escape with a suit of civilian clothes, and return to his own despairing mother. As the poor unfortunate approaches his home, his mother, stretching forth her hands, exclaims, \"My son was dead and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.\""},"The Missing Bridegroom":{"title":"The Missing Bridegroom","plot":"Roberts is in love with Clarice Moulton.

When Ruth was in captivity she was protected from the snow only by the woolen dress she wore. On the homeward march Ononko had given her his blanket to keep her warm.

He was content to sit for hours and listen to her sing and play the old songs on the parlor organ. Fate seemed to be taking good care of affairs, until one day a summer boarder pays the homestead a visit.

She readily consents to taking a ride with him, which meets the approval of her parents, who look upon the young man as highly reputable. Ah! Here is the time-honored trick of fate; the playing with fire, so often the beginning of the end. Some miles away from the village, the auto becomes conveniently disabled, and as it is assumed it will be some time before it is righted, the young man suggests that they go to the roadhouse nearby for rest and refreshments.

But, alas, the poor girl is later made to appreciate the cruel truth of the situation when the young man pretends his father objects to his marrying just at present. He, of course, reasons that she has gone too far to turn back, in fact, she fully realizes her awful predicament, for she knows how the world will regard her apparent indiscretion, so ashamed to return home, she seeks employment. In this direction she meets with the indignities often afforded the innocent by those human vultures who call themselves men. Her experience is enough to convince her of the falseness of the world she would enter, so back home she goes the same day to be received with open arms by her dear old daddy, whose searching gaze she has met with a smile."},"Take Me Out to the Ball Game":{"title":"Take Me Out to the Ball Game","plot":"The Wolves baseball team gets steamed when they find they've been inherited by one K.C.

We see him first in the office of a hospital asking for information as to an operation which shall restore his little crippled sister to health. Then follows the receipt of a letter from the hospital authorities, telling him that the sum of fifty dollars will be needed. This is a large sum for a small boy whose little income is the only means of support for his widowed mother and the aforesaid little sister. But he goes bravely to work to save the money and keeps it a secret. This is why he refuses to spend his money as the other boys do; to play craps, or to buy popcorn or peanuts. Naturally his fellow messengers resent his apparently stingy character and they dub him \"Mike, the Miser.\" They pin a placard on his back which reads: \"Mike, the Miser. He never spends a penny. Don't give him a tip, he ain't wuth enny.\" It is very badly misspelled, but it serves its purpose in the resultant discomfort to poor little Mike. A friendly policeman finally tells him of the sign and takes it off. Mike retains the placard and meeting two of the boys later, discusses the subject with them vigorously, the result being a fight in the snow in which Mike, despite his valor, gets decidedly the worst of it, the other boys considering that they have given only the proper treatment to anyone as close-fisted as our hero. And then follows an accident; stepping off a streetcar, Mike sprains his ankle and is laid up. Fearing to lose his job and thereby lose the chance of paying for the much-desired operation, he writes a note to the Superintendent, asking him to keep the job for him, and telling him how it happened that he is away from work and why he wants to retain the position. This letter falls under the notice of the largest boy in the office and creates in him a sudden change of heart. He shows it to the others and shame covers their small faces. After a few seconds of remorse one of them gets a brilliant idea and producing an old worn pocketbook, he shows how much money it contains and suggests that they all contribute what they can and make up the balance needed for the operation, which balance is now only a few dollars. And then, forming themselves into a committee of the whole, they wait upon our disabled little hero and with immense formality and boyish stiffness tender him a letter of apology and the purse of money. It is too much for little Mike's stubbornness and he breaks down and hides his eyes that the boys may not see the tears. But little sister rewards them as they should be rewarded, by a hug and a kiss for each boy.

Falling at his feet, Father Bob whispered, \"Forgive me, for I knew not what I did.\" In his study the next day they found Father Bob, sitting upright in his chair, tightly clutching the big crucifix on his desk, his glassy eyes fastened on the Savior.
