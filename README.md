# march-lstm-projects
This is a collection of some of the Neural Network / LSTM projects that I have undertaken in March.
You probably shouldn't use much of this code elsewhere, this was mostly a learning experience, and the codebase is messy as hell.
My actual copy of the codebase is much neater, but, not gonna survive the transition to github.

### Overview

There's two main projects left hanging around this codebase.
1) Rapgod
2) DiStriAR

1> This is a Rap Music generator, using tf.keras, and an LSTM.
2> This is an Auto-Responder that I was hooking up to my FB, and training off of my FB Chat history.

Rap music that has been previously generated is still stored in ai-songs

But that, and maybe some code snippets for my future self is all I/we are gonna get out of this repository.

Ciao
